# HTML-User-Authentication-Pages
This project provides a front-end implementation of a user authentication system using only HTML, JavaScript and CSS. It is designed to be a template for sign-in and sign-up pages, which can be integrated into a larger application. It focuses on the user interface without any server-side functionality.
